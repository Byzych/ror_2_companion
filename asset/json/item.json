As you know, he was an extraordinary man in almost any manner. He was athletic, brilliant, kind, funny, and an all-around great human specimen. \n\nHe donated his body to science, and as we began the operation we found a most terrifying discovery.\n\nA quick visual examination of the subjectâ€™s brain shows a veryâ€¦ particular oddity. It seems to be housing a variety ofâ€¦ glowing brain \"stalks\", similar to tubeworms. Trying to biopsy the stalks is impossible - they seem to disintegrate into dust the moment we remove it from the brain. We cannot explain this oddity at all. As such, we have included the entire brain in this shipment.\n\nPlease let us know if you find any explanation.",
